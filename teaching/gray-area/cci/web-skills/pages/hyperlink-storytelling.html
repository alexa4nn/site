                <h1>Hyperlink Storytelling Creative Prompt</h1>
                <p>Hypertext markup language on its own is bare visually but is the primary scaffolding of the internet. It's primary function is to provide connectivity to the rest of the internet through hyperlinks. And this is the way we go from site to site. Storytelling can be linear or non linear. The visual capabilities of HTML are minimal, so utilize what you have learned to create a click through web experience composed of writing and images. Create multiple html files that link to each other to form a written composition. It could be narrative, poetic, philosophical or informational. The goal is for the work to start somewhere, link from page to page, and return back to the beginning.</p>
