                    <p>Helcome to gray area, and welcome to the first module of creative code intensive, web skills!</p>
                    <p>This site might look pretty bare, but that is because it is only composed of HTML – <em>hypertext mark up language</em>.</p>
                    <p>As we learn the make up of the web, I will enable more components of this site like styling! For now, I hope you appreciate this site in it's devoid state.</p>
                    <p>Lets go around the room and introduce ourselves a bit.</p>

                <p>For the next three sessions, we are going to dive deep into the make up of the web and code our own small little site. And in doing so, we will start to make small little plots of our own on the internet. </p> 
                <p>Once you learn the components of what makes up the internet, coding websites can start to feel like a handmade craft. Each line being written and composed carefully. This is called <em>the handmade web</em>.</p>
                <p>But to start off, a little bit of context</p>

                <p><u>Oliana Lialina</u> is a pioneer of net art born in Russia. Her network-based art includes <em>My Boyfriend Came Back from the War</em> (1996), <em>Agatha Appears</em> (1997), <em>First Real Net Art Gallery</em> (1998), and <em>Last Real Net Art Museum </em>(2000). She wrote <em><a href="http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">A Vernacular Web</a></em> in 2005 which talked about the old aesthetics of the World Wide Web I, the web during its amateur state.</p>

                <p>According to Lialina, the amateur web felt boundless and hopeful. Many sites had big "under construction signs". It didn't mean that the site didn't work, it meant that someone was always there maintaining the site. Sites were playful and decorated with sparkly gifs and starry backgrounds. It was customized and expressive with cooperative effort to connect their sites to others.</p>

                <p>In 2015, J. R. Carpenter wrote in his essay, <em><a href="https://www.luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html">The Handmade Web</a></em>, <br><br>
                <em>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.
                </em><br><br>
                <em>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</em></p>

                <p>What is your first internet memory?</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.laurel.world/">Laurel Schwurlst</a> is an artist whose focus is on the poetics of the internet. She wrote <em><a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</a></em>, which compares HTML to building the scaffolding of a house. She goes on to talk about a website as a metaphor – website as a room, as a shelf, as a plant, as a garden, etc.</p>

                <p>With that said, we will begin to explore the handmade web and start by coding purely in HTML. For this you will need a code editor. We will be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>. Once you download that, you should open the editor and navigate to the extensions icon on the very left panel. It should be the last icon. install these extensions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML Boilerplate</li>
                    <li>htmltagwrap</li>
                    <li>Beautify</li>
