    <p>Just recently completing my thesis, I am now lecturing at UC Davis. I plan to teach along with continuing my
        design practice and expanding research projects. I have a passion for sharing my interests with others and I can
        talk for hours about design and my research. Which makes lecturing at a univerity the perfect job for me!</p>
