A website has ever-evolving definitions, and depending who you are asking, the answer would most likely vary. A website might be space to collect, hold memories, connect. It might be a place to trade, sell and grow. It could be a space to explore and a never ending labyrinth for discovery. Do we always need to search or can we be still on the internet?

What is the relationship between the internet to a website? The internet is to blank, as a website is to blank.

That leads me to then ask what affordance does a website provide for a human? In interactive design, according to Adobe, affordances are "a relationship between a person and a physical or digital object." Human to website affordances yield a result. What result do you hope a website you create will yield?
