fluttering entanglement of linking pathways, A place to play and be silly, like improv, Warm, inviting, somewhere to share coffee together in the morning, disco party vibes in the evening. The space can morph through time in the day, A broad sky with a cloud for each user. Ads can be birds flying by, ike a labyrinth of many doors leading to fantastical spaces, Like an audiophiles record collection.A rabbit hole full of info but each with subculture/genre of its own, All the beautiful things together, At no cost, terrarium full of rocks and moss, like a garden, different plants being watered and taken care of based on needs, walking through a forest and finding a secret lake, where chaos, beauty,, story and organization meet, A forest of beautiful doors that open into beautiful spaces for every kind of dweller on every kind of path, A fairy garden, A hot summer day with a light breeze, a really overgrown, abandoned, front garden of a small home that had a bit of care right at the beginning but is now full of entropy and just like nature growing together. Mushrooms! Mold! Vines! Moss! Flowers!, A portal, A place you find by tripping over a rock, more human(less corporate), A virtual ~room(think squishy walls, goopy floors, no ceiling) where you can discuss educate relax listen dance etc, lush, abundant & welcoming, Smells like home, Incomplete, forever WIP
