                    <p>The Quantified Self is best described by Gary Wolf as “self-knowledge through numbers.” William James’ theory of the consciousness of the self and the study of coping inspires drawings that retell personal narratives at the same time reveal traces of the subtle emotion associated with intentional forgetting. Codex Endogenous is a project that reveals and visualizes the beauty and morphology of a “self ” and its environment. Here, “codex” refers to a collection of pages stitched together, and “endogenous” is a term in cognitive neuroscience used to describe phenomena that is spontaneously generated from an individual’s internal state. Every day, quantifiable information about the self is produced; left unrevealed would leave the spirit of a self undiscovered. In this project, the self information is transformed into self-knowledge. Data is tracked throughout a day, categorized into implicit and explicit information, visualized as daily data drawings. Analogous to the practice of keeping a daily journal, Codex Endogenous is a digital journal in a screen-based format. It is composed of drawings that embody data representation of the quantified self in the context of environmental habituation including the intentional redaction of information rather forgotten.</p>

            <p>&#42; All of this work is currently being reworked for a show in June 2022. In all honesty, 21-year-old me was still learning how to make these peices and was too busy making sure it did not fall apart the night it was shown to pay attention to proper documentation. 5 Years later, I will be documenting the remaking of these works. The show will be at Axis Gallery in Sacramento and will be viewable the full month of June. I plan to write about the two separate processes 5 years apart.</p>

                    <p>Theory of Mind Prism is a large scale installation takes data from the people around a space but instead it emits a mirror image made up of grey squares in a grid. A prism of lines oscillating in a light color spectrum, reminiscent of the saturation of color seen emitting from prisms start to connect lines and entangling the viewer and their accompanying friends. Theory of mind is the psychological phenomena that lets living beings understand other’s emotional states. Behavior in this space facilitated a sense of play and joy. Viewers were seen frockling past the installation waiting for their lines to trail behind them and entangle with their friend.</p>

                    <p>Paying homage to Daniel Hertzfelt’s award-winning animations, Pulse of Anonymous Images is one’s memory are displayed with projections onto sheer fabric hanging from the ceiling almost like holograms. The image that is being projection-mapped onto the fabric has photos from an anonymous being. There is a pulse sensor on a pedestal. Once there is a finger on the pulse sensor, the color channels of the image start to become offset creating layered overlapping of color interactions at the rate of the current visitor’s pulse. This forces an intimate interaction with the user and the anonymous being’s memories.</p>

Three panels of sheer fabric hang from the ceiling with a projection of rain falling projection-mapped so that only the fabrics are illuminated in the space. Rain sounds are strong when no one is present, rain sounds are calm when people are present.</p>
