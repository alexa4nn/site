                <p>The Quantified Self is best described by Gary Wolf as “self-knowledge through numbers.” William
                    James’ theory of the consciousness of the self and the study of coping inspires drawings that retell
                    personal narratives at the same time reveal traces of the subtle emotion associated with intentional
                    forgetting. Codex Endogenous is a project that reveals and visualizes the beauty and morphology of a
                    “self” and its environment. Here, “codex” refers to a collection of pages stitched together, and
                    “endogenous” is a term in cognitive neuroscience used to describe phenomena that is spontaneously
                    generated from an individual’s internal state. Every day, quantifiable information about the self is
                    produced; left unrevealed would leave the spirit of a self undiscovered. In this project, the self
                    information is transformed into self-knowledge. Data is tracked throughout a day, categorized into
                    implicit and explicit information, visualized as daily data drawings. Analogous to the practice of
                    keeping a daily journal, Codex Endogenous is a digital journal in a screen-based format. It is
                    composed of drawings that embody data representation of the quantified self in the context of
                    environmental habituation including the intentional redaction of information rather forgotten.</p>

                <p>Mindfulness meditation is proven to improve neurological functions in the parts of the brain
                    responsible for cognitive regulation of emotions like stress and anxiety. The sympathetic nervous
                    system (SNS) is responsible for arousal, including the fight-or-flight response. The SNS moves blood
                    to the muscles for quick action. The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) promotes self-preservative
                    functions like digestion and wound healing. A simple way to experience these systems for yourself is
                    inhaling to activate the SNS and exhaling to activate the PNS.</p>

                <div>
                <p>How do you know that you have the oracle to feel within your own self? At what point does equipping
                    this oracle become a necessity? A common symptom of PTSD is a sense of losing one's body and mind
                    connection. There is a part of the brain responsible for sensing the self called the “default state
                    network” (DNS). It’s how we know we are alive. Patients with PTSD show a startling lack of
                    activation in the self-sensing parts of the brain.</p>

                <h2>Enriching your naturally emitted data</h2>
                <p>Our data is fleeting away from us like a flock of butterflies and you have the chance to catch them
                    to view the beauty of the morphology of the self.</p>
                <h2>How</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sensing technologies(implicit data)</li>
                    <li>Self reporting (explicit data)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The automatic data flow that autonomously emits from our body is implicit because it works in the
                    background outside of our bridge of attention until you explicitly check it and take a mental note.
                </p>
                <p>Self reported data takes on a more narrative based recollection about a state of which you have or
                    are entering. For example, the emotions you experience that metamorphose along a chronological span
                    of time.</p>

                    properties that change depend on numerical or categorical data over a span of time. </p>
