            <p> Previously named Codex Endogenous, Codex will be the name going forward for simplicity. The Quantified Self is best described by Gary Wolf as “self knowledge
                through numbers.” William James’ theory of the
                consciousness of the self and the study of coping inspires
                drawings that retell personal narratives. Codex Endogenous
                is a project that reveals and visualizes the beauty and
                morphology of a “self” and its environment. Here, “codex”
                refers to a collection of pages stitched together, and
                “endogenous” is a term in cognitive neuroscience used to
                describe phenomena that is spontaneously generated from an
                individual’s internal state. Every day, quantifiable information
                about the self is produced and collected like pages in a book.
                Daily data drawing is a method of journaling with naturally
                emitted data from the self, creating an oracle into an
                individual’s brain body connection. This paper evaluates the
                characteristics of what daily data drawings are, methods of
                collecting data, and the possibilities of using data collection
                and visualization as a mindfulness practice for people who are
                diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

            <h1>Designing Interactive Self Data Visualization Tool for Trauma Impacted Individuals</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There is simply too much information to keep track of the
                complex narrative that makes up your own self-hood. When
                you look in the mirror and see yourself, you can point out the
                physical appearance, but it is often a much harder task to
                recall accurate self knowledge. Self knowledge can be
                difficult to unravel and recall because of the complexity of
                themes within our psyche. There is not a mapped out
                visualization with a detailed legend for navigating, but rather
                a novel with sequences of interconnecting events that have
                themes and story lines [13]. A common symptom of Posttraumatic
                Stress Disorder is a sense of losing one’s body and
                mind connection. There is a part of the brain responsible
                for sensing the self called the “default state network” (DNS).
                It’s how we know we are alive. Patients with PTSD show a
                startling lack of activation in the self-sensing parts of the
                brain [10]. Neurofeedback is used as a treatment that uses
                visualization of the “electrical symphony” of a patient’s brain
                waves to cause emotional arousal and in return enhances the
                sense of identity [9]. In effort to build a similar mirroring effect,
                Codex Endogenous provides a reflection of the self each
                day. Generated from naturally emitted data, daily entries have
                the ability to be recorded through a network of devices.
                Codex Endogenous aims to construct a narrative about the
                self by examining drawings produced from devices that
                collect biometric, environmental, and self-reported
                information. A daily representation of data is translated into
                patterns that make up a visual language mapped on a canvas.
                A user may collect pages that adds to their own narrative,
                positively reinforcing identity and relation to one’s own
                environment.</p>
            <p>The inspiration for this project came from the practice of
                meditational drawing. The process involves sketching a
                simple mark on the paper repetitively in a meditative state
                and watching the pattern build and grow into a larger
                complex form. Then the creation of a new pattern begins,
                builds complexity and exists against all the previous patterns
                on the page. With the ability to create graphics with creative
                coding and integrating devices that are best described as the
                Internet of Bodies, a term described by Giorgia Lupi as
                technology that captures and stores information about a
                person’s location, bodily functions, audio and visual
                perception and even self recorded information that would
                reflect an individual’s thoughts [4].</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>This project is situated heavily in generative design as an art
                form. Imagery is created by constraints defined by the data
                that is streaming through a program. The art form originated
                in cybernetics and general systems theory in the late 1960’s.
                Roy Ascott coined the term “cybernetic vision”, referring to
                concepts drawn from computer science. Methods of
                computing to mathematically display graphics using
                algorithms derived from artificial intelligence or artificial life
                [1].</p>
            <p>Codex Endogenous utilizes self-tracking, otherwise known
                as The Quantified Self. Dating back to the first cave paintings,
                humanity has been compelled to record themselves for thousands
                of years. When this complex human tendency to preserve
                themselves combines with the power of computation,
                the conversion of human bodies and minds into data flows are
                figuratively reassembled for the purpose of self-reflection and
                interaction [8]. The quantified self is defined by using
                “invisible technology” in order to collect data that reflects the
                daily lives of people, like a data double. Motivation to collect
                such data comes from a desire to change or improve.</p>
            <p>According to Ksenia Fedorova, technologies that utilize
                biosensing to gain an accurate “picture” of one’s mental and
                bodily state would help create balance with more “informed”
                behavior [2]. This project attempts a snapshot for a person to
                distinguish and identify their mental and bodily state, while
                grounding themselves in the environment. Data is taken from
                streams of data that is left by the self during the span of 24
                hours. Later the data is recalled in a one-time journal-like
                task.</p>
            <p>James divided the history of self into three parts – its
                constituents, the feelings and emotions they arouse, the
                actions to which they prompt. When we use sensors to
                automatically track ourselves, we are reminded that our
                ordinary behavior carries more obscure signals that can be
                used to inform our behavior [12]. The collection of the data
                for this work aims to seek information that makes up the
                empirical self. William James grouped all of the components
                of the empirical self into three subcategories: (1) the material
                self, (2) the social self, and (3) the spiritual self. In this work,
                items of data that include bio-metric, sleep, and environmental
                information can be classified as the material self as it pertains
                to the tangible objects, people or places that carry the
                designation my or mine. Data collected about who people
                interact with each day is classified as the social self. In effort
                to support the spiritual self, thought and emotional data
                through daily survey is collected.</p>
            <p>
                The way in which personal narratives are recalled from
                memory inspired the modality, origin, and meaning of data
                that was used in developing drawings each day. The
                philosophy behind the method of data collection is heavily
                informed by the concept of “Data Humanism”, coined by
                Giorgia Lupi. The idea addresses the issue that as a result of
                the rise of Big Data, attempts at complex infographics
                become merely eye candy and leave us with copious
                amounts of unreadable and cheap graphs and pie charts. In
                actuality, the conventional nature of these visualization lacks
                depth and exploration in possibilities of what could represent
                more meaningful data to the viewer [7].
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Self Data Visualization and Trauma</h2>
            <p>Semiotic explorations within personal data have been used as a tool for simulating and representing
                the inner experiences of individuals using data trails [3], but there is an absence in
                work regarding tools for individuals who are prone to
                experience lack of self, such as patients diagnosed with Post
                Traumatic Stress Disorder. The combination of using self
                data as visual feedback integrated as an artistic representation
                is designed to act as an intervention to promote self-healing.
                Codex Endogenous was developed as a tool for an individual
                to acquire information to act as scaffolding to one’s own self-concept,
                a collection of beliefs and thoughts that make up an
                individual’s perception of the self. A negative self-concept
                is commonly reported amongst patients diagnosed with Post
                Traumatic Stress Disorder [6]. The page like structure of
                Codex Endogenous provides a narrative based experience
                similar to collecting pages in a journal. It is a procedure of data
                collection that is then translated into markings on a page
                through the means of generative art and data visualization.
                The form of the markings are completely determined
                by variables that change based the data collected for graphical
                output onto a page. This means that the graphical form of the
                artistic daily data drawing is completely unique upon the self,
                metaphorically acting as a mirror and acting on an
                individual’s inner experience. For trauma-impacted
                individuals whose inner experience also includes the lack of
                sense of self [11], this intervention is designed to stand in as
                scaffold ing that otherwise is hindered or disabled.</p>
            <p>We can imagine a simple scenario for the use of daily data
                drawings. A person is diagnosed with PTSD and starts to
                receive outpatient care. Their treatment plan includes
                establishing care with a psychiatrist and regularly seeing a
                counselor for talk therapy. While they are receiving care on
                their own, they start to think about journaling as a form of selfcare.
                Codex Endogenous provides them with a free form
                interface to draw out their own daily data trails which
                provides them with feedback about their self-information
                generated from factual data. Their idea of self is now more
                enhanced.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>The thought process behind the format and visual
                representation in this project is informed by an understanding
                of human memory. The term implicit memory refers to when
                a participant does not deliberately attempt to collect
                information from the past, yet memory is still expressed in the
                performance of a task (e.g. walking or playing a learned song
                on the piano). Explicit memory is exhibited when participants
                consciously and deliberately attempt to recollect information
                from the past, such as life events that are primarily sensory
                experiences (e.g. recounting a childhood memory of having
                dinner at their grandparents house) [5]. Self Knowledge requires
                both implicit and explicit memory to form a personal
                narrative. The following describes the ways in which data
                collection parallels memory and functions as the data that
                makes up the self to be used for daily data drawings.</p>
            <p>Given this information, Codex Endogenous proposes that
                there is a connection between data as personal narrative from
                memory and the modality in which data from devices are
                collected. When translated into the visual output, the journal like
                output for personal use is a form of Data Humanism. This
                is because visually representing self-data in respect of self
                psychology, such as the empirical self or what makes up a
                person’s self-concept and human memory, we can approach
                the design of a visualization with more meaning and thoughtfulness.
                Iterating on Lupi’s words – “We are ready to question
                the impersonality of a merely technical approach to data and
                to begin designing ways to connect numbers to what they really
                stand for: knowledge, behaviors, people [7].”, this work
                takes into consideration a humanistic approach with respect
                to the physical.</p>
            <p>A survey of data collection was conducted to deepen the
                understanding between the usage of a device and how the output
                of data is internalized. A myriad of devices was tested,
                such as a Fitbit tracker, web API’s, an eye tracker, cameras,
                and sensors to detect the external environment. The selection
                of data collection methods had to satisfy the following
                criteria:

                <!-- <ul style="padding:0px 0px 0px 100px" > -->
                <li> There is a direct and strong connection oneself narrative to
                    the data that is output.</li>
                <li> A wearable device functions symbiotically with the self
                    with minimal disruption during the day.</li>
                <li> There is a low sense of surveillance.</li>
                <li>The data can be retrieved on the web via API.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>In this project, the method of collection the implicit
                memory data is straightforward. This is because
                implementation is based on setting up the stream of data and
                making it available to be used when it comes time to create a
                daily drawing. This was done using JavaScript. On the other
                hand, it was a more involved design process to achieve a
                accessible and meaningful web interface that collects
                emotions, social information and thoughts.</p>
            <p>Because of the lack of assessing a full range of emotional
                experiences in previous surveys to measure emotion, Harmon
                et al. developed a questionnaire to asses situationally
                induced emotions that expand the range of mood states seen
                previously that asses only specific ranges of emotions such as
                anxiety, pride, and shame and guilt. The importance of a
                tool that assesses emotion comprehensively is because the
                same event occurring in two different individuals’ life may
                evoke two different emotional states between the two.
                Another reason of importance is the possibility of an event
                evoking mixed emotions. The Discrete Emotions
                Questionnaire developed by Harmon et al. includes “basic by
                prominent emotion theories” that allows individuals to
                distinguish emotions and determine a level of which they are
                feeling them. The questionnaire declares eight different
                broader categories of discrete emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear,
                Anxiety, Sadness, Desire, Happiness, and Relaxation.
                Amongst these larger categories, subcategories consisting of
                more specific emotions.</p>
            <p>
                Codex Endogenous takes this list of emotions to be
                checked off each day. To be completed in a way that imposes
                less burden on the user, there is no scale like there is in
                the original questionnaire. While there is worth in denoting
                the intensity of emotions each day and reflecting it in a
                visualization can be achieved easily, the focus was on
                minimizing burden in completion of the form while
                maximizing the sense of being able to identify personal mood
                states, bring it forth to attention and opening the door for
                reflection. It is intended that every day the form would be
                completed. The submitted data goes to a database for later
                retrieval and visual encoding during the data drawing stage.

                The social and thoughts form works the same way as
                emotion and is submitted to a database. The user recounts
                their day and notes memorable names of those who they
                interacted with during the day. The thoughts form prompts the
                user to describe their day in 3 simple words. This answer
                is used to title the drawing. The purpose of the minimalist
                nature of only writing 3 words is because it creates a task
                to pull the most important elements remembered from the day
                and in turn creates less cognitive load when going back into
                the archive of daily drawings. This feature contradicts the
                conventional function of keeping a journal where meandering
                thoughts get written down.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Codex Endogenous seeks to provide groundwork for a
                procedure to concurrently collect personal data pertaining to
                aspects of the self. Two main processes make up the
                procedure: observation of self data trails, including biometric
                and environmental data produced by our network of
                devices and an intervention for collecting emotional, social,
                and thought data. The journal-like collection of daily data
                drawings aims to provide an accessible and non invasive way
                for individuals to receive a semblance of neuro-feedback, as a
                complimentary tool to be combined with professional
                psychiatric treatment and counselling for PTSD patients.
